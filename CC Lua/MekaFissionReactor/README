# Mekanism Fission Reactor
Using ComputerCraft and Mekanismv10 (With AdvancedPeripherals) to control a fission reactor
One program runs on a computer which runs the reactor, the other program runs on a seperate computer which manages the reactor

For now it really only works if there are only two computers in the world because I'm just using RedNet to broadcast the reactor/inductionMatrix values
This should be really easy to fix but I'm lazy and it works for now
